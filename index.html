            <h2>Act 3: The Vessel</h2>
            <p><span data-actor="action">The great doors of the throne room groan shut behind them. Stone columns rise like pillars of judgment. The flicker of torchlight dances across stained glass, and silence weighs heavier than steel.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="rowan">ROWAN: You were never weak, brother. Not in the ways that matter.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="raphael">RAPHAEL: Then why was I passed over like a dying dog? Why did Father strip me of everything?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="rowan">ROWAN: Because of the prophecy. Because of what your Mother saw. You were her child... but also something more. She named you the vessel.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="raphael">RAPHAEL: Vessel? Of what?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="rowan">ROWAN: Mordrius. The god of death. She swore he would return... in you. Father feared it to be true.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="raphael">RAPHAEL: And father believed her? Him—of all people?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="rowan">ROWAN: I believe in you, Raphael. I still do.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="siegward">SIEGWARD: My lords—enough. The court has ears. And worse.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="action">A soft sound echoes: silk over stone. PONTIFF ORIANNA, spearhead of the Church of Celion, steps from the shadows, her hands folded, her voice a prayer and a curse.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="orianna">ORIANNA: At last, the blood ripens. The soul stirs. The vessel wakes.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="raphael">RAPHAEL: What are you doing Orianna?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="orianna">ORIANNA: What I was always meant to do.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="action">She raises her hands. Sigils burn into the air. The torches dim, snuffed by unseen breath. A deep rumble shakes the walls. Shadows coil, forming wings. The Black Dragon watches from beyond the veil.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="rowan">ROWAN: Orianna—stop this madness!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="orianna">ORIANNA: You would deny Dreigard its salvation?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="raphael">RAPHAEL: I am no god. I am no vessel.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="orianna">ORIANNA: Then why do the runes obey you? Why does death cling to you like breath?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="action">The heroes draw steel. Orianna’s form unravels—no longer woman, but wyrm, her shape unraveling into smoke and flame. As the ground cracks and light shatters, Siegward stands resolute, blade raised, between the dragon and the crown.</span></p>
